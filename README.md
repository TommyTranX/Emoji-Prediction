# Emoji-Prediction

## Description: 
Sentiment analysis is generally limited to positive/negative sentiment. Social media such as Twitter offer access to millions of weakly labelled sentences thanks to emojis, since these characters capture in part the sentiment of the whole sentence. We plan to use transformer-based architectures to predict sentiment-related emojis such as love, fear, laugh, anger, etc.

## Datasets: 
10M personally scrapped tweets (with Tweeter API)
